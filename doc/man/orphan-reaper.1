.SH NAME
orphan-reaper - Keep your process tree clean
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR orphan-reaper
[--fatal] [--]
.IR COMMAND ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This user daemon spawns a process and reaps all orphaned
grandchildren. This is useful if you want to keep your
process tree clean. For instance if you want all programs
started from inside the same display server instance to
appear to be inside that display if you look inside the
process tree, rather than all processes that loses their
parent being reparented to PID 1 and make a mess on your
process tree.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-\-fatal
Fail if the process cannot become a subreaper.
.SH RATIONALE
It is really nice to have a processes that are running
inside a display server to be a grandchild of the
display server, rather than being reparanted to PID 1.
Especially when multiple display servers are running.
