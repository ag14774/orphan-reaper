This daemon spawns a process and reaps all orphaned
grandchildren. This is useful if you want to keep
your process tree clean. For instance if you want
all programs started from inside the same display
server instance to appear to be inside that display
if you look inside the process tree, rather than all
processes that loses their parent being reparented
to PID 1 and make a mess on your process tree.
